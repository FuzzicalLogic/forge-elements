# Forge Elements

Compilation of custom elements developed to aid the development and debugging of HTML/CSS/JS applications. While referring to the individual element's documentation may be necessary for specific elements, most should be compatible with both web and nativeweb applications.

## New Elements

* [`<forge-reloader>`](https://github.com/FuzzicalLogic/forge-reloader) - Button and hotkey that allows convenient reloading of nativeweb windows.
* [`<forge-repainter>`](https://github.com/FuzzicalLogic/forge-repainter) - Button and hotkey that allows convenient repainting of document stylesheets (not for use with web component stylesheets).
* [`<forge-titlebar-insert>`](https://github.com/FuzzicalLogic/forge-titlebar-insert) - Mini toolbar of the most common forge-elements for insertion into a native-title-bar.
