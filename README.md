# Forge Elements

Compilation of custom elements developed to aid the development and debugging of HTML/CSS/JS applications. While referring to the individual element's documentation may be necessary for specific elements, most should be compatible with both web and nativeweb applications.

## New Elements

* [`<native-window>`](https://github.com/FuzzicalLogic/native-window) - Adds the function and default interfaces and behaviors for stylizable native windows/forms.
* [`<native-title-bar>`](https://github.com/FuzzicalLogic/native-title-bar) - Element that mimics the Operating System's title bar.
